# Video Monitoring System: Object Detection and Background Subtraction

## Project Overview
This project implements an advanced **Video Monitoring System** that detects and segments moving objects (foreground) from the static background in a video. By leveraging **K-Means Clustering**, **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**, and the **Stauffer-Grimson algorithm**, the system can identify, isolate, and remove foreground objects effectively, making it ideal for security surveillance and monitoring applications.

## Project Details

1. **Input Video**:
   - A **1000-frame video** (~10 minutes long) was used as the input for the system.
   - The video contained dynamic foreground objects against a relatively static background, simulating a real-world monitoring scenario.

2. **Objectives**:
   - **Detect** and **segment** foreground objects from the video frames.
   - **Separate** the foreground and background.
   - **Remove** or **mask** the foreground to isolate a clean background.

3. **Methodology**:
   - ### Step 1: **Preprocessing**
     - Frames of the video were extracted and processed individually for clarity and efficiency.
   
   - ### Step 2: **K-Means Clustering**
     - Used **K-Means Clustering** for initial classification of the pixel intensities.
     - K-means helps in roughly classifying pixels as part of the foreground or background, serving as a preliminary segmentation step.

   - ### Step 3: **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
     - Applied a **Gaussian Mixture Model** to model the background more precisely by fitting multiple Gaussian distributions to each pixel.
     - GMM provides a probabilistic framework that assigns probabilities to pixels, enhancing the accuracy of foreground-background separation.

   - ### Step 4: **Stauffer-Grimson Algorithm**
     - **Stauffer-Grimson (SG) algorithm** was implemented for robust background subtraction, leveraging the GMM framework.
     - The SG algorithm dynamically adapts to gradual changes in lighting and other environmental factors, making it ideal for continuous monitoring.
     - By continuously updating the model, the algorithm effectively distinguishes between stationary background and moving foreground objects.

4. **Output**:
   - The system produced a **clean background** by removing the detected foreground objects from each frame, resulting in a video that isolates the background without interference from moving objects.
   - This output is particularly useful for applications that need background estimation or environmental monitoring.

## Results
The project successfully demonstrated the capability of the **Stauffer-Grimson algorithm** in combination with **K-Means Clustering** and **GMM** for high-precision background subtraction. The final output provided a stable background video, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach for real-world monitoring systems.

## Applications
This project can be expanded or integrated into security systems for:
   - **Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring of areas to detect intrusions or suspicious activity.
   - **Traffic Monitoring**: Isolating moving vehicles or pedestrians from a static road background.
   - **Environmental Monitoring**: Observing background changes in natural settings without interference from transient objects.
